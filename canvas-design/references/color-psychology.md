## Color Harmony Types

### Complementary
**Colors directly opposite on the color wheel.** Maximum contrast and visual tension.

```
Example: Blue (#4299E1) ←→ Orange (#ED8936)

Best for: CTAs against a dominant background, emphasis
Caution: Don't use at equal saturation/proportion — one should dominate
```

### Analogous
**Three colors adjacent on the color wheel.** Harmonious and serene.

```
Example: Blue (#4299E1) — Blue-Green (#38B2AC) — Green (#48BB78)

Best for: Cohesive, unified designs, nature themes, gradients
Caution: Can lack contrast — add a neutral for balance
```

### Triadic
**Three colors equally spaced (120° apart).** Vibrant and balanced.

```
Example: Red (#E53E3E) — Blue (#4299E1) — Yellow (#ECC94B)

Best for: Playful, dynamic designs, children's products
Caution: Use one dominant color, two as accents (60-30-10 rule)
```

### Split-Complementary
**A base color plus the two colors adjacent to its complement.** High contrast with less tension than pure complementary.

```
Base:        Blue (#4299E1)
Complement:  Orange (#ED8936)
Split:       Red-Orange (#E53E3E) + Yellow-Orange (#ECC94B)

Best for: Beginners — easier to balance than complementary
```

### Tetradic (Rectangle)
**Four colors forming a rectangle on the wheel — two complementary pairs.**

```
Example: Blue (#4299E1) + Orange (#ED8936) + Green (#48BB78) + Red (#E53E3E)

Best for: Rich, complex palettes (dashboards, data visualization)
Caution: Hard to balance — let one color dominate strongly
```

### Monochromatic
**Single hue with variations in lightness and saturation.**

```
Example: Blue family
  #2A4365 (dark)
  #3182CE (base)
  #63B3ED (light)
  #BEE3F8 (very light)

Best for: Elegant, focused designs, single-brand emphasis
Caution: Can feel monotonous — add one accent color for energy
```

## Accessibility Considerations

### WCAG Contrast Ratios

| Level | Normal Text (< 18px) | Large Text (≥ 18px / 14px bold) | UI Components |
|-------|---------------------|--------------------------------|--------------|
| AA | 4.5:1 | 3:1 | 3:1 |
| AAA | 7:1 | 4.5:1 | Not defined |

### Common Problematic Combinations

| Combination | Issue | Fix |
|------------|-------|-----|
| Light gray text on white | Fails AA | Use `#718096` or darker |
| Red on green (or reverse) | Color blindness conflict | Add icons/patterns alongside color |
| Yellow text on white | Very low contrast | Use `#92700C` or add a dark background |
| Blue links on blue background | Indistinguishable | Use underlines + different shade |
| Thin light-colored text | Appears washed out | Increase weight or darken color |

### Color Blindness Considerations

~8% of men and ~0.5% of women have some form of color vision deficiency.

- **Never use color alone** to convey information — pair with icons, labels, or patterns
- **Deuteranopia** (red-green): Most common. Avoid red/green only distinctions for status
- **Protanopia** (red weakness): Red appears dark/black. Ensure red elements have sufficient luminance contrast
- **Tritanopia** (blue-yellow): Rarest. Blue and yellow may look similar

**Safe status palette:**
```
Success:  #38A169 (Green) + ✓ checkmark icon
Warning:  #D69E2E (Amber) + ⚠ triangle icon
Error:    #E53E3E (Red)   + ✕ cross icon
Info:     #3182CE (Blue)  + ℹ info icon
```

## Palette Generation Tools

### Manual / Algorithmic
- **HSL manipulation:** Start with a base hue, shift hue ±30° for analogous, ±180° for complementary
- **Lightness variants:** Keep hue/saturation fixed, vary lightness (25%, 45%, 65%, 85%)
- **Saturation variants:** Keep hue/lightness fixed, vary saturation for muted vs vibrant

### Online Tools
| Tool | URL | Strength |
|------|-----|----------|
| Coolors | coolors.co | Quick random palette generation |
| Adobe Color | color.adobe.com | Harmony rules + accessibility check |
| Realtime Colors | realtimecolors.com | See palette applied to real UI |
| Contrast Checker | webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker | WCAG compliance testing |
| Who Can Use | whocanuse.com | Simulates color blindness impact |
| Huemint | huemint.com | AI-powered palette for brand/web |
| ColorBox by Lyft | colorbox.io | Systematic color scale generation |

### The 60-30-10 Rule

A simple distribution formula for balanced palette application:

```
60% — Dominant color (backgrounds, large surfaces)
30% — Secondary color (cards, sections, supporting elements)
10% — Accent color (CTAs, highlights, interactive elements)
```

**Example for a recipe platform:**
```
60% — #FFFDF7 (Warm white — page backgrounds)
30% — #FFF5EB (Warm cream — card backgrounds, sections)
10% — #E53E3E (Red — buttons, hearts, key CTAs)
```

## Quick Reference: Color Selection Decision Tree

```
1. What emotion should the design evoke?
   → Map to primary color family (see associations above)

2. What industry/context?
   → Check industry palettes for conventions

3. Choose a harmony type
   → Complementary for energy, analogous for calm, triadic for vibrancy

4. Build the full palette
   → Primary + Secondary + Accent + Neutral scale (gray)

5. Test accessibility
   → Check all text/background combinations against WCAG AA (4.5:1)

6. Test for color blindness
   → Simulate deuteranopia, protanopia, tritanopia

7. Apply the 60-30-10 rule
   → Assign distribution percentages to each color
```

# Documentation Writing Standards

## Language Principles

- **Concise**: Use the fewest words necessary to convey meaning
- **Clear**: Avoid ambiguity and jargon unless defined
- **Active Voice**: Prefer active over passive voice (e.g., "The function validates" not "Validation is performed by the function")
- **Present Tense**: Describe functionality in present tense
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Explain concepts that may be unfamiliar to new users

## Formatting Standards

- Use consistent heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Include code fences with language specification: \` \`\`javascript \`\` \`
- Use inline code for function names, variables, and file paths with backticks
- Define list items with proper indentation

## Code Best Practices

- Include imports and setup code
- Ensure examples are complete and runnable
- Document expected output clearly
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for non-obvious logic

## Common Pitfalls

- ❌ Using vague descriptions ("does something useful")
- ❌ Outdated code examples
- ❌ Missing critical steps
- ❌ Using undocumented assumptions about user knowledge
- ❌ Failing to document error scenarios

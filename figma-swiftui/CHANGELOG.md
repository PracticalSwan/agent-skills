## [2026-08-20] - Vendor Skill Import

### Added

- Imported the canonical `skills/figma-swiftui` workflow from `https://github.com/figma/mcp-server-guide` at commit `7f6562c4900fafb46e5e8fd3cc8ced954779bab3`.
- Normalized catalog metadata, retained-client portability, MCP fallback, safety, verification, and related-skill routing.

# Java Documentation (Javadoc) Best Practices

- Public and protected members should be documented with Javadoc comments.
- It is encouraged to document package-private and private members as well, especially if they are complex or not self-explanatory.
- The first sentence of the Javadoc comment is the summary description. It should be a concise overview of what the method does and end with a period.
- Use `@param` for method parameters. The description starts with a lowercase letter and does not end with a period.
- Use `@return` for method return values.
- Use `@throws` or `@exception` to document exceptions thrown by methods.
- Use `@see` for references to other types or members.
- Use `{@inheritDoc}` to inherit documentation from base classes or interfaces.
  - Unless there is major behavior change, in which case you should document the differences.
- Use `@param <T>` for type parameters in generic types or methods.
- Use `{@code}` for inline code snippets.
- Use `<pre>{@code ... }</pre>` for code blocks.
- Use `@since` to indicate when the feature was introduced (e.g., version number).
- Use `@version` to specify the version of the member.
- Use `@author` to specify the author of the code.
- Use `@deprecated` to mark a member as deprecated and provide an alternative.

## Cross-Client Portability

This skill is written to stay usable across GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI.

- GitHub Copilot: keep the folder in a Copilot-visible skill or plugin path, or wrap the workflow as project instructions if the host does not support portable skill folders directly.
- Claude Code: keep the folder in a local skills directory or a compatible plugin or marketplace source.
- Codex: install or sync the folder into `$CODEX_HOME/skills/<skill-name>` and restart Codex after major changes.
- Gemini CLI: this repository generates a project command named `/skills:java-docs` from this skill. Rebuild commands with `python scripts/export-gemini-skill.py java-docs` and then run `/commands reload` inside Gemini CLI.

## MCP Availability And Fallback

No dedicated MCP server is required for the normal workflow in this skill.

- If the current host lacks an equivalent tool surface, use the bundled scripts, standard shell or editor tooling, and the manual workflow already described in this skill.
- Treat local verification as the fallback evidence path before closing the task.
